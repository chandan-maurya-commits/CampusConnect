# 🎓 Campus Connect

> A centralized college communication and management platform built using Django.

## 📌 Problem Statement

During our initial days in college, we faced difficulty accessing important information because it was scattered across WhatsApp groups, Google Forms, and notice boards. Many students missed deadlines and updates.

There was no centralized system to manage academic activities, clubs, and placement drives.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Campus Connect provides a centralized platform where:

- Students receive announcements in one place
- Faculty can upload assignments
- Clubs can post updates
- Placement drives are managed systematically
- Role-based dashboards ensure organized access

## 🚀 Features
